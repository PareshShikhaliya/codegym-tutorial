FileInputStream and BufferedInputStream are both classes in Java that can be used
 to read data from a file, but there are some key differences between them.

FileInputStream is a class that reads data from a file one byte at a time
 It is not buffered, which means that every time you read a byte from the stream,
  it will access the file and read one byte.
   This can be slow,
    especially if you are reading a large file
     or if you are reading small amounts of data frequently.


BufferedInputStream is a class that provides buffering for a FileInputStream.
 It reads data from a file in larger chunks (a buffer),
  and stores the data in memory.
   This allows for faster reading of data from the file because the application
    doesn't have to access the disk as frequently.
     When you call the read() method on a BufferedInputStream,
     it will read data from the buffer first,
      and only access the file when the buffer is empty.

In summary, the key difference between FileInputStream and BufferedInputStream is
that FileInputStream reads data from a file one byte at a time,
while BufferedInputStream reads data from a file in larger chunks and stores the data in memory
 for faster access. BufferedInputStream is generally faster than FileInputStream,
  but it requires more memory because it buffers the data.
   If you need to read small amounts of data frequently,
   FileInputStream might be the better choice,
   but if you need to read large amounts of data or read data less frequently,
    BufferedInputStream is likely to be more efficient.
